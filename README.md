# AirBnB Clone Project

## Overview
This project is a full-stack clone of the popular accommodation booking platform, AirBnB. The goal is to build a fully functional web application where users can browse property listings, view detailed information and book accommodations. It includes frontend design, backend APIs, database design and deployment.

## Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (React)
- **Backend**: Node.js or other
- **Database**: MongoDB or PostgreSQL 
- **Design Tool**: Figma for UI/UX design
- **Version Control**: Git and GitHub


## UI/UX Design Planning

### Design Goals
- Create an intuitive booking flow
- Maintain visual consistency across pages
- Ensure fast loading times
- Prioritize mobile responsiveness

### Key Features
- Property search and filtering
- Viewing detailed property information
- Secure checkout process
- User authentication

### Primary Pages

| Page | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Property Listing View** | Grid display of available properties with filters |
| **Listing Detailed View** | Complete property details with images and booking form |
| **Simple Checkout View** | Streamlined payment and booking confirmation |

### Importance of User-Friendly Design
A user-friendly booking system minimizes friction, boosts conversion rates, and enhances customer satisfaction. Clear navigation, responsive layout and an intuitive interface are essential for a smooth user experience.
