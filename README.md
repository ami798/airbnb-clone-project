## Overview

This project is a full-stack clone of the popular accommodation booking platform, AirBnB. The goal is to build a fully functional web application where users can browse property listings, view detailed information and book accommodations. It includes frontend design, backend APIs, database design and deployment.

## Tech Stack

### Frontend

* **Languages & Frameworks**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (React)
* **Design Tools**: Figma (for UI/UX design)
* **Version Control**: Git and GitHub

### Backend

* **Framework**: Django or Node.js
* **Database**: PostgreSQL or MongoDB
* **API**: REST or GraphQL
* **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions, Docker

## UI/UX Design Planning

### Design Goals

* Create an intuitive booking flow
* Maintain visual consistency across pages
* Ensure fast loading times
* Prioritize mobile responsiveness

### Key Features

* Property search and filtering
* Viewing detailed property information
* Secure checkout process
* User authentication

### Primary Pages

| Page                      | Description                                            |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Property Listing View** | Grid display of available properties with filters      |
| **Listing Detailed View** | Complete property details with images and booking form |
| **Simple Checkout View**  | Streamlined payment and booking confirmation           |

### Importance of User-Friendly Design

A user-friendly booking system minimizes friction, boosts conversion rates, and enhances customer satisfaction. Clear navigation, responsive layout and an intuitive interface are essential for a smooth user experience.

### Figma Design Specifications

#### Color Styles

* **Primary**: `#FF5A5F`
* **Secondary**: `#008489`
* **Background**: `#FFFFFF`
* **Text**: `#222222`
* **Secondary Text**: `#717171`

#### Typography

* **Primary Font**: Circular
* **Headings**: Bold (700), 24px–32px
* **Body Text**: Medium (500), 16px
* **Secondary Text**: Book (400), 14px

### Why Design Properties Matter

Identifying design properties such as color, typography and layout ensures consistency between the mockup and the final product. It also helps developers implement a visually cohesive and user-friendly interface.

## UI Component Patterns

### Planned Components

**Navbar**

* Logo
* Search bar
* User navigation links (e.g., login, bookings)
* Responsive hamburger menu for mobile

**Property Card**

* Property image thumbnail
* Basic details (price, location, rating)
* Favorite (like) button
* Responsive layout

**Footer**

* Site links (About, Contact, FAQs)
* Company information
* Social media links
* Copyright

All components will be reusable and styled according to the Figma design system to ensure consistency across the application.

## Frontend Development Best Practices

### Version Control

* Use **feature branches** for new work
* Follow **clear commit messages** (e.g., `feat: add PropertyCard component`)
* Maintain **modular folder structure** (components, pages, assets)
* Keep documentation up-to-date

### Contribution Workflow

* Clone the repository
* Create a branch for the feature or fix
* Push changes and create a pull request
* Assign reviewers and address feedback

## Backend Overview

The backend of the AirBnB Clone handles business logic, user authentication, property management, bookings, reviews, and payments. It uses Django as the main web framework and PostgreSQL for data storage. APIs are secured using JWT tokens, and automated deployment is handled using CI/CD pipelines.

## Database Design

### Entities and Relationships

* **Users**

  * `id`, `name`, `email`, `password`, `role`
  * A user can book multiple properties.

* **Properties**

  * `id`, `title`, `location`, `price`, `host_id`
  * A property belongs to a host (user).

* **Bookings**

  * `id`, `user_id`, `property_id`, `check_in`, `check_out`, `payment_status`
  * A booking is linked to both a user and a property.

* **Reviews**

  * `id`, `user_id`, `property_id`, `rating`, `comment`
  * Each user can review properties they’ve stayed in.

* **Payments**

  * `id`, `booking_id`, `amount`, `payment_method`, `payment_status`
  * Linked to a booking.

## Feature Breakdown

* **User Management**

  * Registration, login, and profile editing

* **Property Management**

  * Hosts can add/edit/delete properties

* **Booking System**

  * Users can browse, filter, and book properties

* **Review System**

  * Users can leave reviews and ratings

* **Payment Integration**

  * Secure checkout and transaction history

## API Security

* **Authentication**: JSON Web Tokens (JWT)
* **Authorization**: Role-based access control (Host vs Guest)
* **Rate Limiting**: Protect from abuse and DDoS
* **Input Validation**: Prevent injection attacks
* **Data Encryption**: Sensitive fields (like passwords) are hashed or encrypted

Security ensures user data privacy, safe transactions, and trust in the system.

## CI/CD Pipeline

* **CI (Continuous Integration)**: Automatically run tests and linting on every pull request using GitHub Actions
* **CD (Continuous Deployment)**: Automatically deploy to platforms like Vercel or Heroku after successful builds

**Tools:** GitHub Actions, Docker, Vercel/Render
