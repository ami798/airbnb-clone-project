# AirBnB Clone Project

## Overview
This project is a full-stack clone of the popular accommodation booking platform, AirBnB. The goal is to build a fully functional web application where users can browse property listings, view detailed information, and book accommodations. It includes frontend design, backend APIs, database design, and deployment.

---

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (React)
- **Backend**: Django, Node.js (alternative)
- **Database**: PostgreSQL or MongoDB
- **Design Tool**: Figma for UI/UX design
- **Version Control**: Git and GitHub
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions, Docker
- **API**: RESTful or GraphQL APIs

---

## UI/UX Design Planning

### Design Goals

- Create an intuitive booking flow
- Maintain visual consistency across pages
- Ensure fast loading times
- Prioritize mobile responsiveness

### Key Features

- Property search and filtering
- Viewing detailed property information
- Secure checkout process
- User authentication

### Primary Pages

| Page | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Property Listing View** | Grid display of available properties with filters |
| **Listing Detailed View** | Complete property details with images and booking form |
| **Simple Checkout View** | Streamlined payment and booking confirmation |

### Importance of User-Friendly Design
A user-friendly booking system minimizes friction, boosts conversion rates, and enhances customer satisfaction. Clear navigation, responsive layout, and an intuitive interface are essential for a smooth user experience.

### Figma Design Specifications

#### Color Styles

- **Primary**: `#FF5A5F`
- **Secondary**: `#008489`
- **Background**: `#FFFFFF`
- **Text**: `#222222`
- **Secondary Text**: `#717171`

#### Typography

- **Primary Font**: Circular
- **Headings**: Bold (700), 24px–32px
- **Body Text**: Medium (500), 16px
- **Secondary Text**: Book (400), 14px

### Why Design Properties Matter
Identifying design properties such as color, typography, and layout ensures consistency between the mockup and the final product. It also helps developers implement a visually cohesive and user-friendly interface.

## UI Component Patterns

### Planned Components

**Navbar**
- Logo
- Search bar
- User navigation links (e.g., login, bookings)
- Responsive hamburger menu for mobile

**Property Card**
- Property image thumbnail
- Basic details (price, location, rating)
- Favorite (like) button
- Responsive layout

**Footer**
- Site links (About, Contact, FAQs)
- Company information
- Social media links
- Copyright

All components will be reusable and styled according to the Figma design system to ensure consistency across the application.

---

## Version Control & Best Practices

- Use **feature branches** for new work
- Follow **clear commit messages** (e.g., `feat: add PropertyCard component`)
- Ensure **modular folder structure** (components, pages, assets)
- Apply **mobile-first design**
- Follow **WCAG accessibility guidelines**
- Maintain updated **documentation**
- Write **unit and integration tests** for critical components

---

## Contribution

Contributions to the project should follow the team workflow:
- Clone the repository
- Create a branch for the feature or fix
- Push changes and create a pull request
- Assign reviewers and address feedback

---

## Backend Planning Phase

### Team Roles

- **Backend Developer**: Implements server-side logic, builds REST/GraphQL APIs, ensures performance and security.
- **Database Administrator (DBA)**: Designs schema, manages indexing, backups, and optimizes queries.
- **DevOps Engineer**: Automates deployment via CI/CD tools, manages Docker containers, ensures uptime.
- **Security Specialist**: Implements secure authentication, authorization, and data protection.
- **API Architect**: Defines endpoints, structures data flow, and optimizes communication between frontend and backend.
- **Product Owner**: Prioritizes backend features to support business goals and user needs.

---

### Technology Stack

- **Django**: Python framework for backend logic and RESTful APIs.
- **PostgreSQL**: Relational database for structured property, booking, and user data.
- **GraphQL** *(optional)*: Advanced querying support.
- **Docker**: Containers for consistent development/deployment environments.
- **GitHub Actions**: Automate tests, builds, and deployment.

---

### Database Design

#### Entities

1. **Users**
   - id, name, email, password (hashed), is_host
2. **Properties**
   - id, title, location, price_per_night, host_id (FK)
3. **Bookings**
   - id, user_id (FK), property_id (FK), check_in, check_out, total_price
4. **Reviews**
   - id, user_id (FK), property_id (FK), rating, comment
5. **Payments**
   - id, booking_id (FK), amount, method, status

#### Relationships

- One User → many Properties
- One Property → many Bookings and Reviews
- One Booking → one Payment

---

### Feature Breakdown

- **User Authentication**: Register/login with secure password storage.
- **Property Management**: Hosts add/edit/delete property listings.
- **Search & Filter**: Guests search based on location, price, etc.
- **Booking System**: Check-in/out, date selection, availability, price calculation.
- **Reviews**: Guests leave reviews and ratings after booking.
- **Payment Handling**: Capture booking payments securely.
- **Admin Panel (optional)**: Manage users, reviews, payments centrally.

---

### API Security

- **Authentication**: Use JWTs or session tokens for secure logins.
- **Authorization**: Restrict routes (e.g., only hosts can edit listings).
- **Rate Limiting**: Prevent spamming with API usage limits.
- **Input Validation**: Sanitize and validate all API input data.
- **HTTPS Only**: Secure all requests with HTTPS.

---
